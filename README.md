Ian Thomas, Ishaan Rajan, Tanner Watts.

### Overview
This is the final project for MathBio 5110. We analyzed the differential equations from "COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND BACKWARD BIFURCATION ANALYSIS ON COVID-19 TRANSMISSION MODEL CONSIDERING DIRECT AND INDIRECT TRANSMISSION" a paper written by DIPO ALDILA (Department of Mathematics, Universitas Indonesia, Depok 16424, Indonesia) https://doi.org/10.28919/cmbn/4779.

### Tools
The analysis used Python as the main programming language. Google collab was the lightweight online IDE we used to collaborate on the analysis. Mathematically, Euler's method was used to solve the differential equations. And Matplotlib was used for the figures.
